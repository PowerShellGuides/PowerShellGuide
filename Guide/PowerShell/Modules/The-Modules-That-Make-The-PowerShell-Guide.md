The PowerShell Guide is open source (that's where there's a small cat in the corner of this window, staring blankly at you).

In case you're afraid of cats or just want a more clear link, you can find the PowerShell Guide Repository at:

[https://github.com/PowerShellGuides/PowerShellGuide](https://github.com/PowerShellGuides/PowerShellGuide)

There are a few modules we use to build the PowerShell guide.  These run on every checkin.

These are:

* [PSSVG](https://github.com/StartAutomating/PSSVG) (this makes a pretty picture or two)
* [EZOut](https://github.com/StartAutomating/EZOut) (this makes the guide work and look pretty)
* [PipeScript](https://github.com/StartAutomating/PipeScript) (this makes dynamic content within the guide)
* [HelpOut](https://github.com/StartAutomating/HelpOut) (this generates help content)
