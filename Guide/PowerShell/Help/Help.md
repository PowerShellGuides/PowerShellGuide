We could all use a little help.

Luckily PowerShell cares about help enough to provide a whole subsystem for it,
so that we might have any clue how things work.

We can use Get-Help to get help about a command.

~~~PowerShell
Get-Help Get-Command # Get Help about Get-Command
~~~

We can also get help about topics.

~~~PowerShell
Get-Help about_Operators # Get the built-in help about operators.
