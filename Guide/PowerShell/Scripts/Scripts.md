A Scripting Language has to have a script file, now doesn't it?

After all, nobody wants to type everything in a terminal, especially after it stretches more than a few lines.

In PowerShell, script files are named with the extension `.ps1` (regardless of if you're running PowerShell 7).

A `.ps1` is interpreted the same way as it would be if you typed the script in the terminal, it just has new capabilities.

For one, once you have a script file, you can call that file at any time as a command.

Scripts can also contain inline help and rich parameters.
