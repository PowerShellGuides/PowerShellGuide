Scripting languages are programming languages that are interpreted when they run.

This is unlike a compiled programming language, which is turned into machine code and run.

Nobody ever wants to deal with machine code.

Scripting Languages offer some distinct advantages to their compiled kin, such as:

* Generally being easier to read
* Requiring fewer references
* Being more flexible
* Tolerating more problems 

However, compiled programmers have threatened to beat us with a wet noodle if we do not state the two major advantages of compilation:

* Machine code is faster
* (some) problems can be discovered while compiling.
