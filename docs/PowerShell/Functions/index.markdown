Please believe me, functions are quite fun.

[PowerShell](/PowerShell) functions are [commands](/PowerShell/Commands) written directly in [PowerShell](/PowerShell).

Most [commands](/PowerShell/Commands) you run and most [commands](/PowerShell/Commands) you build will be functions.

Functions are named [scriptblocks](/PowerShell/ScriptBlock).
