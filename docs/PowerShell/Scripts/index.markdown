A [Scripting Language](/Languages/Scripting-Languages) has to have a script file, now doesn't it?

After all, nobody wants to [type](/PowerShell/Types) everything in a terminal, especially after it stretches more than a few lines.

In [PowerShell](/PowerShell), script files are named with the extension `.ps1` (regardless of if you're running [PowerShell](/PowerShell) 7).

A `.ps1` is interpreted the same way as it would be if you typed the script in the terminal, it just has new capabilities.

For one, once you have a script file, you can call that file at any time as a [command](/PowerShell/Commands).

Scripts can also contain [inline help](/PowerShell/Help/Inline-Help) and rich [parameters](/PowerShell/Parameters).
