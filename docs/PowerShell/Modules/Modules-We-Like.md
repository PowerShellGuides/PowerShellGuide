Well, this is hard.  There are so many [modules](/PowerShell/Modules) to choose from, and we don't want to be unfair to the many [modules](/PowerShell/Modules) that exist.

## dbatools

Are you or do you deal with a database administrator?  If so, we feel sorry for your extended exposure to SQL.  If you'd like to make SQL work together with [PowerShell](/PowerShell) though, there's a vibrant community of DBAs that do amazing things with [PowerShell](/PowerShell).

A great place to get started with that is [dba tools](https://dbatools.io/)

Check out their wonderful website @ [https://dbatools.io/](https://dbatools.io/)

## ImportExcel

It's a well know fact of life in business that managers like graphs.  It's equally known that excel is adored by accountants and other lovers of data (and dirty file formats).  Amongst programmers, Excel development is a special circle of hell known as Excel Hell, where one can spend eons figuring out how to do simple things like populate a spreadsheet.

[ImportExcel](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel) is one of the indispensible [modules](/PowerShell/Modules) for anyone in business.

## Mailozaurr

OK, boomers, we know you love your emails, and scripters know they can be a serious pain to deal with.  In the early days of email and [PowerShell](/PowerShell), there was Send-MailMessage.  It remains as a mocking husk of what could be easy.  To escape this pain and send mail in a more modern way, we've found that [Mailozaurr](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Mailozaurr) can be a useful way to deal with this ancient form of communication.
