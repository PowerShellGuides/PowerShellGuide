We could all use a little help.

Luckily [PowerShell](/PowerShell) cares about help enough to provide a whole subsystem for it,
so that we might have any clue how things work.

We can use [Get-Help](/PowerShell/Commands/Get-Help) to [get help](/PowerShell/Commands/Get-Help) about a [command](/PowerShell/Commands).

<pre><br/><span class='Warning'>Get-Help</span>&nbsp;<span class='Verbose'>Get-Command</span>&nbsp;<span class='Success'># Get Help about Get-Command</span><br/></pre>

We can also [get help](/PowerShell/Commands/Get-Help) [about topics](/PowerShell/Help/About-Topics).

<pre><br/><span class='Warning'>Get-Help</span>&nbsp;<span class='Verbose'>about_Operators</span>&nbsp;<span class='Success'># Get the built-in help about operators.</span><br/></pre>
