PowerShell is a [scripting language](/Languages/Scripting-Languages) and a [shell](/Shells), and a rather good one of each of these things.

Of course neither of these things mean much without context.

[Scripting languages](/Languages/Scripting-Languages) are [programming languages](/Languages/Programming-Languages) that are interpreted when they run.

[Shells](/Shells) are the surface layer of a language or operating system.

## PowerShell - The [Scripting Language](/Languages/Scripting-Languages) (The powerful part of PowerShell)

---


PowerShell, the [scripting language](/Languages/Scripting-Languages), is one of the most interesting creatures into the vast ecosystem of programming.

PowerShell has many unique features, allowing it to do many things no other language can.

Features like:
  * An [Object Pipeline](/PowerShell/Concepts/The-Object-Pipeline) that lets you send data from step to step.
  * An Extended [Types](/PowerShell/Types) System that allows you to customize existing [types](/PowerShell/Types).
  * Cmdlets that let you easily run anything built in PowerShell.
  * Extensible [Commands](/PowerShell/Commands) that let you run anything else.
  * Splatting which allows you to easily pass [parameters](/PowerShell/Parameters) around.
  * An Events Engine that lets you script asynchronously.

PowerShell is written in C#, and anything in .NET can be used in PowerShell.

PowerShell scripts are written in `.ps1` files, and can be run inside or outside of the [shell](/Shells).

## PowerShell - The [Shell](/Shells)

---

PowerShell comes with it's own [shell](/Shells).

For Windows PowerShell, that [shell](/Shells) is PowerShell.exe, and for PowerShell Core, the [shell](/Shells) is pwsh.

PowerShell.exe will only run on Windows, and has been built into Windows since Windows 7.

PowerShell Core is cross platform.

PowerShell (the [shell](/Shells) part) can do some nifty things, like:

* Display progress
* Prompt for input (including credentials)
* Confirm impactful decisions
* Tab through [commands](/PowerShell/Commands) and [parameters](/PowerShell/Parameters)
