Commands are a concept that far predates [PowerShell](/PowerShell), and a concept [PowerShell](/PowerShell) embraces wholeheartedly and does wonderful things with.

Commands, put simply, are what you use to tell a computer to do something.

## Commands in [PowerShell](/PowerShell)

When you're talking about something like an operating system, a command is often called an Executable or an Application.

One way you can think of [PowerShell](/PowerShell) is like an operating system on top of the operating system.

Every executable or file in an operating system is a command to [PowerShell](/PowerShell),
and [PowerShell](/PowerShell) has a lot more commands you can use on top of that.

[PowerShell](/PowerShell) has a few [types](/PowerShell/Types) of commands:

|Command Type|Description|
|-|-|
|Alias|Another name for a command|
|Function|A [PowerShell](/PowerShell) function|
|Cmdlet|A Compiled [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Command|
|ExternalScript|A [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Script File|
|Application|A operating system application or file|

Sometimes you'll hear people refer to Applications as Native Commands and the other command [types](/PowerShell/Types) as [PowerShell](/PowerShell) commands.

In addition to having more command [types](/PowerShell/Types) than your operating system does, [PowerShell](/PowerShell)'s commands are a bit more capable.

* Every command that runs can produce one or more objects, which can flow into [the object pipeline](/PowerShell/Concepts/The-Object-Pipeline).
* Commands have rich command metadata.
* [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Commands have rich parameters and parameter metadata.
* Commands in [PowerShell](/PowerShell) can be stopped (often without summarilly executing the process).
