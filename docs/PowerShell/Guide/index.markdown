<span style='font-size:1.3em'>PowerShell</span> is <span style='font-size:1.2em'>big</span>.

_Really_ <span style='font-size:1.25em'>big</span>.

You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-boggling big it is.

You may think it's a long way down the road to understanding any language,
but that's just peanuts compared to the the vast universe you can use in [PowerShell](/PowerShell).

<br/>

<div style='text-align:center'>
    <span style='font-size:3em'>
        Don't Panic
    </span>
    <br/>            
    <br/>
</div>


You have The [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Guide.

<br/>
<br/>


The [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Guide aims to be the standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom.
<br/> <span style='font-size:.9em'>(or at least all knowledge and wisdom related to [PowerShell](/PowerShell), you'll have to ask someone else about life, the universe, and everything)</span>

Here are some topics that may help you get started:

* [What Is PowerShell](/PowerShell)
* Variables
* [Conditionals](/PowerShell/Conditionals)
* [Loops](/PowerShell/Loops)
* [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Scripts
* [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Functions
* [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Parameters
* Commands
* Modules

You can browse the guide online or download the [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Guide as a module.

What's a module, you ask?

Why not ask the [PowerShell](/PowerShell) Guide?

That's what it's here for.

We told you not to panic.
