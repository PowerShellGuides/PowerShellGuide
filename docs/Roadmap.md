The [PowerShell Guide](/PowerShell/Guide) is a living book and has a little bit of growth until it's mature enough to get a drink.

Here are some of thing we are considering for the [PowerShell Guide](/PowerShell/Guide).

You're welcome to add your own ideas in our [Issues](https://github.com/PowerShellGuides/PowerShellGuide/issues)
and [Discussions](https://github.com/PowerShellGuides/PowerShellGuide/discussions).

Here some thing we'd like to do:


## Search

Search should be available on any page.  In case you're not quite sure what you want (like most of the human race)

## Sitemap

We should be able to see all of the topics hierarchically.  Not that we love pecking orders, but, filesystems are somewhat build atop them.

## Course / Course Levels

We'd love to present the concepts in the [guide](/PowerShell/Guide) at various levels of knowledge.  For example, when we're introducing the concept of a [programming language](/Languages/Programming-Languages), we doubt you're far beyond 100 level of knowledge.

## Solid Social Media Integration

As much as we all may dislike it, people spend time on social media.  Therefore, the [PowerShell Guide](/PowerShell/Guide) should excel at integration into various social media sites.  At least in theory.  In practice, we'll see which ones exist in a few months.

## Local Version

We'd very much like the [PowerShell Guide](/PowerShell/Guide)'s [module](/PowerShell/Modules) to be as nice to view in a terminal as it is in a browser.  It just feels right, or, less wrong.

## Percentage Unread 

We should be able to determine when content is published or updated, and use this with a notch of HTML5 local storage to determine if you've read this topic.

## History

Those who forget history are doomed to search online again.  Let us save them from this fate by using some HTML5 local storage to help keep track of what has been read.

## Privacy Expecations

As we've just been talking about how to track what you're doing, please, rest assured, we don't have any interest in you or your data.  We want everyone to understand [PowerShell](/PowerShell) and do not collect any information ourselves.  Shall we ever add advertisers, I'm sure they will have their own terms and conditions.

## Service Workers / Installing as an App

Not that we wish too much more pain upon ourselves, but we probably want to figure out how to be installable as a client app, which involves a somewhat misleadingly named web standard called a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).

## Finer Control of Settings

The color schems should be more customizable than they currently are, and should be remembered as you move from page to page.

Also, any settings related to history or storage should be available in roughly the same place, lest you want to look up our addresses and brain us for poor web design.

## Pretty Graphs and other Assetations.

A picture can be worth a thousand words (or five thousand produced by GPT).  We we would love to have a few more graphs and photos throughout the site.

## Possibly Centralized Examples

In order to avoid insanity thru repetition, we should probably centralize our examples, so that we can reuse demos and examples throughout multiple topics.

## Integration with other [module](/PowerShell/Modules)'s documentation.

We'd love to be able to cohesively link to lots of other [modules](/PowerShell/Modules).  Figuring out how, exactly, might be a bit tricky.
