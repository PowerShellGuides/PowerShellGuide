Programming languages vary in strength.

They also vary in how strongly [types](/PowerShell/Types) are treated.

[Types](/PowerShell/Types) can be thought of as boxes of information with labels on them telling us what [type](/PowerShell/Types) of box it is.

In a strongly typed language, this is a very serious contract that shall not be violated.

To that end, you can think of programming in a strongly typed compiled language as something like pair programming with the least fun lawyer your can imagine.

Joke as we will, there is a place in the world for strongly typed languages, as well as for lawyers.

One of the most strongly typed languages we can think of is C#.  In C#, about everything is explicitly typed, and you have to convert everything fairly explicitly.

[PowerShell](/PowerShell) [_is](/PowerShell/Operators/Type-Operators) not_ a strongly typed language.  Instead, it's actually quite [type promiscuous](/Languages/Weakly-Typed-Languages).
