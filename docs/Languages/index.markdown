All Languages are used to communicate.

Natural Languages are the languages we use in our everyday lives.  They're written and and spoken throughout the world.  They're wonderful, useful things.

Civilization would crumble for lack of communication, and languages are the key to how we all try to connect to each other, no matter our rates of success.

When humanity began to get clever enough to make machines do math and more, they quickly determined doing everything with punchcards was a problem for people.

And so some humans set out trying making a languages somewhere in between what we write and what computers can read.

We began to create [programming languages](/Languages/Programming-Languages).

Then we wanted to run those languages interactively, so we built [scripting languages](/Languages/Scripting-Languages) and [shells](/Shells).

[PowerShell](/PowerShell) is a [scripting language](/Languages/Scripting-Languages) that lets you do amazing things with [the object pipeline](/PowerShell/Concepts/The-Object-Pipeline).

It's one of the more [high level languages](/Languages/High-Level-Languages) around, meaning it's designed to be closer to natural language than most.

While we could pontificate for ages on the nature of languages, we'd prefer to help you understand [PowerShell](/PowerShell) and programming.
