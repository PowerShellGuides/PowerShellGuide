High level [languages](/Languages) are [programming languages](/Languages/Programming-Languages) that at least try to be understandable.

Unfortunately, there's quite a bit of variation on how much they succeed.

The most common example of a high level language is [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

Some say the lack of features in this language is the reason that basic became an insult.

We say that BASIC is a basic attempt by programmers of the 60s to be understandable.

We also say that [PowerShell](/PowerShell) is a much higher level language than you're every likely to see, due to it's [verb-noun](/PowerShell/Concepts/Verb-Noun) convention.
