Programming languages are the languages we use to communicate with computers.

As a general rule, programming languages are not as artful as natural languages.

In fact, they can often seem a little bit scary or arcane.  We remind you:  Don't panic.

If a programming language looks like something vaguely like a natural language, it's called a [high level language](/Languages/High-Level-Languages).

If a programming language looks like something truly arcane, it's called a [low level language](/Languages/Low-Level-Languages).

[PowerShell](/PowerShell) is quite a nice programming language, once you get the hang of it.

If it's the only one you know, you may potentially die happpy (not that we have much control over that, or your opinions).

Here are a few of the reasons we believe that [PowerShell](/PowerShell) is quite a programming language:

* It's a [Scripting Language](/Languages/Scripting-Languages) with a [Shell](/Shells), which makes it easy to try
* It has things other languages lack (like the object pipeline)
* It talks to many other languages easily
* You can use [PowerShell](/PowerShell) as a very [high level language](/Languages/High-Level-Languages)
* You can write low level code in [PowerShell](/PowerShell) when you need to.
