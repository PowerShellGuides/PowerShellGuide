Scripting [languages](/Languages) are [programming languages](/Languages/Programming-Languages) that are interpreted when they run.

This is unlike a compiled [programming language](/Languages/Programming-Languages), which is turned into machine code and run.

Nobody ever wants to deal with machine code.

Scripting [Languages](/Languages) offer some distinct advantages to their compiled kin, such as:

* Generally being easier to read
* Requiring fewer references
* Being more flexible
* Tolerating more problems 

However, compiled programmers have threatened to beat us with a wet noodle if we do not state the two major advantages of compilation:

* Machine code is faster
* (some) problems can be discovered while compiling.
